# Todo App

"Todo App is a widely-used application for managing tasks, deadlines, and reminders. I developed this app by utilizing Flutter, which is a UI toolkit, along with Provider and RiverPod for managing the state of the application. This allowed me to implement the features of adding and deleting tasks. To manage local data storage, I employed the use of the Hive package. For handling directories, I used the path_provider package and the equatable package to override ==. To handle API requests, I chose the Dio package due to its ease of use and powerful interceptor system, which provides greater customization options and better performance compared to the built-in https package".
